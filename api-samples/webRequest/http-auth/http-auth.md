# webRequest.onAuthRequired

This sample demonstrates the `webRequest.onAuthRequired` listener to detect an authentication request and log the user into the designated site.

When an authentication check is detected, a check is made to confirm that the request has come from the correct source. Account credentials are then provided for the response via an auth handler.
